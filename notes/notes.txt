using populate will return all the user information and not just the id, useful for working with user id responses (MAX 220)
can use populate on clique to pull all data related to the clique
** can also filter the populated return of the whole object to just one field
Clique.find().populate('userId')
Clique.find().populate('userId','username')

using select will work as a filter and return the written field from the database
** can also filter fields out by using a minus -
Clique.find().select('clique_name')
Clique.find().select('clique_name -clique_about')
